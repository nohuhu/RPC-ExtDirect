RPC-ExtDirect
=============

ABSTRACT

RPC::ExtDirect is a Perl implementation for Ext.Direct remoting protocol
used in ExtJS JavaScript framework by Sencha Inc.

WHAT IS IT FOR?

There are many RPC protocols out there; ExtJS framework provides yet another
one. In short, it is a means of calling server side code from client side
JavaScript without having to mess with HTML, forms, AJAX and stuff like that.
Besides providing forward asynchronous data stream (client calls server),
Ext.Direct also defines a mechanism for backward (server to client) event
stream, also asynchronous. Add some perks like standartized exception
handling, request batching and file uploads and you get an engine that
greatly simplifies client to server interaction in JavaScript applications.
