RPC::ExtDirect
==============

    RPC::ExtDirect suite of modules provides an easy, simple and robust way
    to write Perl server side code that could be used with HTML5 Rich
    Internet Applications based on JavaScript frameworks Ext JS and Sencha
    Touch.

    The suite consists of the core RPC::ExtDirect module that implements
    Ext.Direct protocol and transport layer, several server
    environment-specific peripheral gateways, a standalone pure Perl server,
    two Perl clients, and even its own specialized testing scaffold! We've
    got it covered front to back. :)
