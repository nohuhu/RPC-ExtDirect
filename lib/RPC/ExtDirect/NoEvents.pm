### PUBLIC CLASS METHOD (CONSTRUCTOR) ###
#
# Initializes new instance of NoEvents. This is a stub event
# we have to return when there are no actual events returned
# by the poll handlers. Certain Ext JS versions had a bug that
# resulted in JavaScript exception thrown when an empty array
# of events was returned; returning one stub event instead
# works around that problem.
