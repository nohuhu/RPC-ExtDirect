=head1 NAME

RPC::ExtDirect::Config - Centralized configuration handling for RPC::ExtDirect

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RPC::ExtDirect::Config;
    
    my $cfg = RPC::ExtDirect::Config->new(
        option1 => 'value1',
        option2 => 42,
        ...
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package implements configuration handling for various RPC::ExtDirect
modules in a centralized and consistent fashion.

RPC::ExtDirect::Config also supports the legacy configuration approach
via package global variables, as implemented in RPC::ExtDirect 1.x and 2.x.
Note that using package global vars is deprecated, and Config will emit
a warning for every such variable. The value in the variable will still
take effect, despite the warning.

=head1 CHAINED OPTIONS

Besides simple configuration options, RPC::ExtDirect::Config supports
"chained" options that fall back to another option when no value
is provided.

Assume an option C<foo> that is chained to option C<bar>. When assigning
values, Config will set both C<foo> and C<bar> independently. When
retrieving value for option C<bar>, Config will first look if C<bar>
has any value defined for it and return it if there is one. However,
when there is no value defined for C<bar>, Config will then "fall back"
to the value of C<foo>, and return it instead.

This allows for very granular configuration of different parts of the
RPC::ExtDirect stack. For example, you can turn on global debugging
with the L</debug> option, and turn off Request debugging by
setting L</debug_request> to falsy value.

It is possible to add your own configuration options, both simple and
chained. Read RPC::ExtDirect::Config source to see how it is done.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new(%options)

Create a new Config instance and populate it with key/value pairs from
%options. If an option is not specified, a default value will be assumed;
see L</OPTIONS> for more information.

The supported legacy package global variables will be read before the
%options is processed; thus any option passed directly to constructor
will override its namesake in a package global. This won't prevent the
warnings from being emitted; package global vars are strongly deprecated
and should not be used. There is no way to disable the warnings.

=item clone()

Create and return a new instance of Config as a copy of the current one.
This method only does shallow copy, i.e. any config option that is a
reference will refer to the same object.

=item set_options(%options)

Apply the passed options to the current Config instance.

=item get_router_path()

Return the current L</router_path> value.

This method is deprecated and is provided only for backwards compatibility
with RPC::ExtDirect 1.x and 2.x.

=item get_poll_path()

Return the current L</poll_path> value.

This method is deprecated and is provided only for backwards compatibility
with RPC::ExtDirect 1.x and 2.x

=item get_remoting_var()

Return the current L</remoting_var> value.

This method is deprecated and is provided only for backwards compatibility
with RPC::ExtDirect 1.x and 2.x.

=item get_polling_var()

Return the current L</polling_var> value.

This method is deprecated and is provided only for backwards compatibility
with RPC::ExtDirect 1.x. and 2.x.

=head1 OPTIONS

The stock RPC::ExtDirect::Config supports the following options:

=over 4

=item api_action_class

Class name to use instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::API::Action> when creating
the API tree. Action objects instantiated from this class will hold
collections of Method objects.

Use this option to override or inject new functionality in Action objects.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::API::Action'>.

=item api_method_class

Class name to use instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::API::Method> when creating
the API tree. Method objects will be instantiated from this class.

Use this option to override or inject new functionality in Method objects.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::API::Method'>.

=item api_hook_class

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::API::Hook> when creating
the API tree. Hook objects will be instantiated from this class.

Use this option to override or inject new functionality in Hook objects.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::API::Hook'>.

=item debug

Turn global debugging flag on or off.

Default: C<!1> (false).

=item debug_api

Turn API debugging on or off. At this time, the only effect is that the
API JavaScript is pretty printed when debugging.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</debug>.

=item debug_eventprovider

Turn debugging on/off for RPC::ExtDirect::EventProvider module.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</debug>.

=item debug_serialize

Turn debugging on/off for serialization method in
L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> module. This option only affects
"from Perl to JSON" conversion.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</debug>.

=item debug_deserialize

=item debug_request

Turn debugging on/off for L<RPC::ExtDirect::Request> module. When
debugging is on, Request will provide verbose exceptions. There
is no other effect at this time, but this can change in the
future.

To make exceptions informational without turning on debugging,
set L</verbose_exceptions> option.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</debug>.

=item debug_router

Turn debugging on/off for L<RPC::ExtDirect::Router> module. When
debugging is on, all Requests or Exceptions generated in the Router
will provide verbose exceptions. There are no other effects at this
time, but this can change in the future.

To make exceptions informational without turning on debugging,
set L</verbose_exceptions> option.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</debug>.

=item exception_class

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Exception> when
instantiating new Exception objects.

This option will affect all places in the code that can throw
Exceptions, unless overridden by specific options below.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Exception'>.

=item exception_class_serialize

Class name to be used when instantiating Exception objects thrown
in serialization method of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> module.

This option will not affect any other place in the code that can
throw Exceptions.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</exception_class>.

=item exception_class_deserialize

Class name to be used when instantiating Exception objects thrown
in deserialization method of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> module.

This option will not affect any other place in the code that can
throw Exceptions.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</exception_class>.

=item exception_class_request

Class name to be used when instantiating Exception objects thrown
in L<RPC::ExtDirect::Request>, when a Request is being processed.

This option will not affect any other place in the code that can
throw Exceptions.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</exception_class>.

=item request_class

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Request> when
instantiating new Request objects.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Request'>.

=item request_class_deserialize

Class name to be used when instantiating Request objects in
deserialization method of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> module.

This option will not affect any other place in the code.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</request_class>.

=item request_class_eventprovider

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Request::PollHandler>
when instantiating Request objects in L<RPC::ExtDirect::EventProvider>
module.

PollHandler is a subclass of Request; when configuring this option
use a subclass of PollHandler.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Request::PollHandler'>.

=item serializer_class

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> when
instantiating new objects to be used to serialize data (Perl to JSON).

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer'>.

=item serializer_class_api

Class name to be used when instantiating Serializer objects used to
serialize API data.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</serializer_class>.

serialize Request results in L<RPC::ExtDirect::EventProvider> module.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</serializer_class>.

=item serializer_class_router

Class name to be used when instantiating Serializer objects used to
serialize Request results in L<RPC::ExtDirect::Router> module.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</serializer_class>.

=item deserializer_class

Class name to be used instead of L<RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer> when
instantiating new objects to be used to deserialize data (JSON to Perl).

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Serializer'>.

=item deserializer_class_router

Class name to be used when instantiating Serializer objects used to
deserialize incoming Request data in L<RPC::ExtDirect::Router> module.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</deserializer_class>.

=item json_options

Hashref of options to be passed to C<JSON::to_json> and C<JSON::from_json>
functions. This is a global option that affects both directions for all
JSON-related operations.

See L<JSON> for explanation of the options.

Default: C<undef>.

=item json_options_serialize

Options to be passed to C<JSON::to_json> when serializing outbound data.
This will affect only "Perl to JSON" direction.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</json_options>.

=item json_options_deserialize

Options to be passed to C<JSON::from_json> function when deserializing
inbound data. This will affect only "JSON to Perl" direction.

Default: C<undef>, chained to: L</json_options>.

=item router_class

Class name to be used when instantiating Router objects instead of
L<RPC::ExtDirect::Router>. This config option is not used directly by
the core RPC::ExtDirect code, but rather by the gateways like
L<CGI::ExtDirect> and L<Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect>.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::Router'>.

=item eventprovider_class

Class name to be used when instantiating EventProvider objects instead of
L<RPC::ExtDirect::EventProvider>. Similar to L</router_class>,
this option is used by the gateway modules.

Default: C<'RPC::ExtDirect::EventProvider'>.

=item verbose_exceptions

Turn informative exceptions on/off. For whatever reason, Ext.Direct spec
requires server stack to return detailed exceptions in debugging mode,
replacing them with generic "An error has occured" in production mode.
Most probably this was done to increase application security, but as the
result it hinders development and support greatly.

RPC::ExtDirect tries to be spec compliant, but provides a way to turn on
verbose exceptions via this config option. This will not affect debugging,
only exceptions returned to the client side.

Default: C<!1> (false).

=item api_path

URI path for the Ext.Direct API generator handler. This option is not
used directly by the core RPC::ExtDirect code; gateways like
L<CGI::ExtDirect> and L<Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect> use this option
to map incoming HTTP GET requests to the RPC::ExtDirect::API code
that generates the JavaScript API declaration for the client side
service discovery request.

Default: C<'/extdirectapi'>.

=item router_path

URI path for the Ext.Direct router handler. This path is advertised in
the Ext.Direct API declaration generated by the API handler, to be used
by the client side when making Ext.Direct routing requests.

Default: C<'/extdirectrouter'>.

=item poll_path

URI path for the Ext.Direct poll handler. This path is advertised in the
Ext.Direct API declaration generated by the API handler, to be used
by the client side when making Ext.Direct event polling requests.

Default: C<'/extdirectevents'>.

=item remoting_var

Name of the JavaScript variable for the remoting API declaration. The
JavaScript code generated by the API handler will look like this:

C<Ext.app.REMOTING_API={...}>

Default: C<'Ext.app.REMOTING_API'>.

=item polling_var

Name of the JavaScript variable for the polling API declaration. The
JavaScript code generated by the API handler will look like this:

C<Ext.app.POLLING_API={...}>

Default: C<'Ext.app.POLLING_API'>.

=item namespace

JavaScript namespace to be declared in the remoting API. See
L<Ext.direct.RemotingProvider|http://docs-origin.sencha.com/extjs/5.0.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.direct.RemotingProvider-cfg-namespace>
documentation for more detailed information on this option.

Default: C<''> (empty string).

=item auto_connect

When set to truthy value, RPC::ExtDirect::API will add JavaScript code
to automatically set up RemotingProvider and PollingProvider on the
client side to the Ext.Direct declaration JavaScript chunk, so that
JavaScript application won't need to do that.

Default: C<!1> (false).

=item no_polling

Explicitly disable polling API advertisements in the generated Ext.Direct
API, even if there are EventProvider modules registered with RPC::ExtDirect
stack. This option is mostly used for testing and debugging.

Default: C<!1> (false).
