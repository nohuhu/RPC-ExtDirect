Revision history for Perl extension RPC::ExtDirect.

1.21  Mon Nov 21 00:39:12 2011
    - Fixed dependency on Attribute::Handlers version >= 0.87 as
      an attempt to fix failing tests reported by CPAN testers.

      Removed versions from all packages except RPC::ExtDirect.
      No point in versioning submodules, it only confuses me.

1.20  Tue Oct  4 21:16:00 2011
    - Fixed a bug in RPC::ExtDirect::API: Methods with 0 numbered
      parameters (i.e. no parameters at all) were not defined
      properly in generated JavaScript API string.

1.10  Sat Oct  1 20:41:28 2011
    - Fixed improper exception handling: RPC::ExtDirect::Exception
      object did not contain required 'action', 'method' and 'tid'
      properties which prevented client side from knowing which
      request raised an exception.

1.02  Fri Sep 30 11:18:13 2011
    - Fixed an embarrassing error in RPC::ExtDirect Pod.

1.01  Fri Sep 30 00:00:39 2011
    - Minor changes to documentation; added $VERSION to Demo modules.

1.00  Thu Sep 29 14:42:39 2011
	- Original version.
